    "In this exercise we will use tools from neuroscience community to learn some dynamics of spiking neurons. Specifically, We will learn to simulate and monitor an integrate-and-fire neuron (leaky I&F) neuron, and plot its Frequency-Input (FI) curve. We then simulate a neuron with one excitatory synapse and do an Frequency-Frequency (FF) curve for different weight values.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use [Brian2](https://brian2.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to simulate our spiking neurons. There are other options available (NEST, PyTorch, etc.), but Brian2 is both fast and flexible when working with spikes. More importantly, our group has already implemented the neural and synaptic circuit models of our custom neuromorphic processor DYNAP-SE1 on Brian2, which we will learn in the future lectures."
