    "The computational principles of the brain are vastly different from conventional computers. Rather than using Boolean logic, clocked operation, and distinct memory and processing units, the biological brain works at massively parallel, fault-tolerant, asynchronous manner. In neuromorphic engineering, we aim to design compact, energy-efficient computational devices that directly _emulate_ the style of computation of the brain with **the physics of the silicon.** To achieve that, we use analog Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) technology to implement neural and synaptic circuits and integrate into Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) devices. In these architectures, time represents itself (no clock) - neurons process the incoming spikes as they arrive and produce output spikes in real-time. Consequently, to process real-world sensory signals efficiently, neuromorphic systems must use circuits with biologically plausible time constants that match environment statistics ($\\sim 10-100$ ms). \n",

    "DPI circuit shown above is the fundamental building block to implement silicon neurons and synapses with tunable time-constants. It is totally fine if you do not understand how it works from the circuit diagram right away. The essence is that it has the response dynamics (the relation of input current $I_{i n}$ and output current $I_{out}$) of\n",

    "$$\\tau \\frac{d}{d t} I_{o u t}+I_{o u t}=\\frac{I_{g}}{I_{\\tau}} I_{i n},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau \\triangleq C U_{T} / \\kappa I_{\\tau}$ ($C$ the capacitor, $U_T$ thermal voltage, $\\kappa$ subthreshold slope factor). DPI circuit can be tuned by adjusting the time constant, $I_{\\tau}$, and the gain factor by $I_{g}$. Hence DPI is simply a current-mode low pass filter with adjustable gain and time-constant. This will be the building block of silicon neurons and synapses.\n",

    "The above schematic shows the neuron circuit implementing Adaptive Exponential Integrate & Fire (AdEx) on Dynap-SE1. AdEx neurons are introduced by [Brette and Gerstner, 2005](https://www.readcube.com/library/a457847f-fdff-4d66-a32a-b3830a010b34:72216f6a-1527-440d-b775-be66fa7085a1) that capable of describing known neuronal firing patterns, e.g., adapting, bursting, delayed spike initiation, initial bursting, fast-spiking, and regular spiking. We will not go into detail of circuit analysis but describe the functional blocks. The yellow block is the input DPI circuit modeling neuron's leak conductance. The green block implements an additional low-pass ﬁlter that integrates the spikes and produces a slow current $I_{ahp}$ responsible for spike-frequency adaptation. The red block is a spike event generation amplifier implementing current-based positive feedback (modeling both $Na^{+}$ activation and inactivation conductances) and produces address-events at extremely low-power operation. Lastly, the blue block resets the neuron and keeps it in a resting state for a refractory period, set by the $V_{ref}$ bias voltage. Under some assumptions, the response dynamics of neuron block is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau \\frac{d}{d t} I_{m e m}+I_{m e m} \\approx I_{i n}-I_{a h p}+f\\left(I_{m e m}\\right)$$\n",
    "$$\\tau_{a h p} \\frac{d}{d t} I_{a h p}+I_{a h p} \\approx I_{a h p} \\delta\\left(t_{s p i k e}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $I_{m e m}$ is the sub-threshold current that represents the real neuron's membrane potential variable, $I_{i n}$ is the input current that enters the neuron, $I_{a h p}$ characterizes the spike adaptation effect, $\\tau$ is the time-constant of leakage current. $f(x)$ is an exponential function with positive exponent which characterizes the passive properties, i.e. $f(x) = \\alpha e^{ \\beta x - \\gamma} + \\delta$.\n",

    "#### Silicon Synapse\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/synapse.png\" alt=\"Synapse circuit.\" style=\"width: 400px;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, the above schematic shows a typical silicon synapse circuit implemented on Dynap-SE1. The green block implements short-term depression (STD). The yellow block implements basic DPI dynamics and can be tuned to implement short-term facilitation (STF). The red block implements NMDA voltage-gated channels, and the blue block implements conductance-based voltage dependence. The simplified version of the response dynamics of the synaptic block is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau \\frac{d}{d t} I_{s y n}(t)+I_{s y n}(t)=I_{w} \\delta\\left(t_{p r e}\\right)$$\n",
    "where $I_{s y n}$ is the synaptic current, $I_{w}$ is the gain factor (weight) of the synapse, and $\\tau$ is time constant of current decay.\n",

    "In neuroscience, spike-frequency adaptation is defined as reducing a neuron's firing rate to a stimulus of constant intensity. Hence, when stimulated with a constant stimulus, many neurons initially respond with a high spike frequency that decays down to a lower steady-state frequency. Do you remember when a smell seems to be fading after you get used to it? Yeah, this can be implemented with spike-frequency adaptation.\n",

    "In our silicon neurons, the spike-frequency adaptation mechanism is implemented by an additional DPI filter that models the neuron's Calcium conductance that produces the after-hyper-polarizing current $I_{ahp}$, which is proportional to the neuron's mean ﬁring rate. There are two parameters on the chip to tune the strength of spike-frequency adaptation (don't forget, this is a DPI circuit). The rest will be taken care of by the physics of the silicon:\n",
